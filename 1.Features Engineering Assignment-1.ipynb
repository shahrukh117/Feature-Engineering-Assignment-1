    "The Filter method in feature selection is a technique used to select the most relevant features from a dataset based on certain statistical properties or scores, independent of the machine learning model. It works by evaluating each feature individually and ranking them according to a predefined criterion, such as correlation with the target variable, information gain, chi-square test, or mutual information. The most important features are then selected based on their scores or statistical properties."

    "The main difference between the Wrapper method and the Filter method in feature selection lies in how they assess the importance of features. While the Filter method evaluates features independently, the Wrapper method assesses the importance of features by considering their performance in the context of a specific machine learning algorithm or model. In other words, the Wrapper method uses the performance of a classifier or model as a measure of feature importance, whereas the Filter method does not."
